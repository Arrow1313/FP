\subsection{Identification of the lines and measurement of the absorption}

In this measurement all 39 theoretical expected lines in the spectrum should be measured. At first the pressure for this measurement has to be around 10$^{-1}$mbar and constant. The pressure during the measurement was at 9,8$ \cdot$ 10$^{-2}$. The measurement started at the 28GHz, because the peaks in that range are bigger then the ones at the beginning of the spectrum. For the measurement of the peaks the wave meter was used. The dip from the wave meter was positioned right on the dip of the NH$_3$ and the frequence was the take from the wave meter. Then the oscilloscope was used to determine the hight of the peaks. For that the dip of the wave meter was scrolled out of the visible spectrum on the oscilloscope. Then the to bars on the oscilloscope were used to determine the size of the dip. 

With the size of the dip the absolute absorption coefficient can be calculated. The absolute absorption coefficient is calculated by formula \ref{equ:alpha}. U$_0$ was not know so the coefficients where normed to the size of the the 3 3 peak, so $\alpha_{rel_{3,3}}$ = 1. All measured Date can be find in table \ref{tab:data_39_1},\ref{tab:data_39_2}.

\begin{align}
\label{equ:alpha}
\alpha_{rel} = \frac{10}{l} \cdot ln(1- \frac{U_a}{U_0})
\end{align}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
l & lenght of the wave guide, 5m in this buildup \\ 
U$_a$ & the intensity without any absorption \\ 
U$_0$ & the intensity of the measured peak \\ 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

\subsection{Hyperfinestructure}
In this section the quadrupole moment of the NH$_3$ will be calculated using the hyperfine structure. Three peaks where measured for the calculation but only for 2 of them the fit for the five peaks converged. The process of fitting and analyzing the data is done as example for the 3 3 peak, for the 4 4 peak the same procedure was used.

At first a calibration is done, because the oscilloscope can only measure the current depended on the time. For the calibration 3 peaks where created with the wave meter, so the frequency is known for them. The peaks are fitted with a Lorentz distribution, witch is given in equation \ref{equ:lorentz}. 

\begin{align}
\label{equ:lorentz}
f(x) = \frac{A}{\pi} \cdot \left( \frac{\sigma}{(x-\mu)^2 + \sigma^2} \right)
\end{align}

To get a better fit result, first the underground was fitted and subtracted from the data. For the fit of the underground a polynomial of sixth degree was used. An example can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hf_untergrund}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

The data without the underground and a peak for the calibration can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hf_untergrund_fit}. The values of the centers of the Lorentz distribution obtained with the fits are given in table \ref{tab:claib_6_6}.

\end{tabular}

The linear fit for the dependency between time and frequency is given in figure \ref{fig:hf_lin_fit} the parameters can be found in table \ref{tab:claib_6_6_lin}.

3 & 0.0406(3) & 1.12 \\ 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

The fit for the 3 3 peak with the hyperfine structure can be seen in figure \ref{fig:hf_6_6}, the parameters of the fit are in the appendix \ref{sec:hf_anhang}.

\end{figure}

From the positions of the peaks the quadrupole moment of can be calculated. For the calculation the distance between the main peak and the side peaks is needed. The distances between the main peak and the side peaks in given in table \ref{tab:qudru_fit_data}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Distances of the side peaks to the main peak}
\label{tab:qudru_fit_data}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
Peak & Side & Distance of the outer/MHz & Distance of the inner/MHz \\ \hline 
3 3  & Right & 2.52(4) & 1.82(1) \\ 
3 3 & Left & 2.47(3)  & 1.76(4) \\ 
4 4 & Right & 2.55(3) & 2.068(9) \\ 
4 4  & Left & 2.72(4) & 2.10(2)  \\ 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}


With equation \ref{eqn:Hyperfine} the quadrupole moment can be calculated, $\beta$ is taken from \cite{examenarbeit}. In table \ref{tab:quad_data} the calculated values for the quadrupole moment are given.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Calculated quadropol moments}
\label{tab:quad_data}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
Peak & Side & Inner peak/MHz & Outer peak/MHz \\ \hline 
3 3 & Right & 5.29(5) & 5.82(1)  \\ 
3 3 & Left & 5.65(2) & 5.91(3) \\ 
4 4 & Right & 4.54(3) & 4.40(2) \\ 
4 4 & Left & 4.33(4) & 4.25(3) \\ 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

The mean of the values in table \ref{tab:quad_data} is 5.02(9), the theoretical value is 4.14 \cite{hf_book}.



\subsection{Dependency between pressure and line width of the 3 3 peak}
In this section the dependency between the pressure and the line width will be examined. The 3 3 Peak was chosen, because it was was the biggest one. For the measurement the pressure is increased in steps and the spectrum is measured. The line broadening is given by equation \ref{equ:broadening}.

\begin{align}
\label{equ:broadening}
\Delta\nu = \sqrt{\frac{273}{T}} \cdot p \cdot \Delta
\end{align}

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{c|l}
$\Delta \nu$ & line broadening at a temperature of 273K \\ 
T  & room temperature \\ 
p & pressure \\
$\Delta$ & specific to the gas, for NH$_3$ $\Delta$ = 29 $\frac{Mhz}{mmHg}$ \\ 
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

For the calculation of $\Delta$ a calibration of the data is needed, because the oscilloscope only gives a time-volt dependency. For the calibration the centers of the three peaks with a know wave frequency are used and fitted with a linear model. The Peaks are fitted with a Lorentz distribution, see equation \ref{equ:lorentz}. The fit parameters for the calibration are in table \ref{tab:pressure_fit}. The Fit and the data can be seen in figure \ref{fig:druck_fit}.

\begin{table}[H]

2 & 0.0269(8) & 1.23 \\ 
3 & 0.0110(5) & 1.12 \\  
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

With equation \ref{equ:broadening} $\Delta$ can be calculated, where T=300K and $\Delta \nu$ = 20(1).

\begin{align*}
\Delta = 20(1) \sqrt{\frac{300}{273}} \frac{\text{MHz}}{\text{mbar}} = 21(1) \frac{\text{MHz}}{\text{mbar}} = 28(1) \frac{\text{MHz}}{\text{mmHg}}
\end{align*}
